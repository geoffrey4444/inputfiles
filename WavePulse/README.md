# WavePulse
These input files make and evolve initial data for a single non-spinning
Kerr-Schild black hole, initially at rest at the origin, and an 
incoming Gaussian Teuskolsky wave pulse. The wave perturbs the black hole, 
which then rings down after absorbing the wave. 

These input files are minimally updated from those used in 

    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3922.pdf

They certainly could stand further cleanup, but the current version 
runs successfully on ocean.
