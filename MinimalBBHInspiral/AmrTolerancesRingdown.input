# This file is intentionally empty. Before Ringdown, AmrDriver.input and
# ApparentHorizonFinders.input get their tolerances from AmrTolerances.input.
# When Ringdown starts, all input files with names ending in Ringdown are
# renamed by removing Ringdown. For example, AmrDriverRingdown.input is renamed
# to AmrDriver.input. However, these new input files have tolerances defined
# within them and AmrTolerances.input is no longer used. By having an empty
# AmrTolerancesRingdown.input, this will get renamed to AmrTolerances.input in
# Ringdown, thus avoiding any possible confusion.
#
# This can be replaced in the future, if AmrDriverRingdown.input and
# ApparentHorizonFindersRingdown.input are updated to read from
# AmrTolerancesRingdown.input
